# EpyTodo

## Introduction

 This Epitech project was an introduction to web developpment.

The goal of the subject was to create the back-end of a todo app. We had 3 weeks to complete it in a group of 3. 

epyTodo was one of my favorite subject of the year as I felt working on it would totally help me for my 1st internship and later on.

## Installation

  In order to run epyTodo, you will have to install nodejs, npm and mysql.
  
Run `sudo apt install nodejs npm -y` in order to install nodejs and npm and follow [this tutorial to install mysql](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04)

Install the app dependencies by running `npm install`.

Export the .sql file by running `cat epytodo.sql | mysql -u root -p` and start sending requests after lauching the app with `node src/index.js`
